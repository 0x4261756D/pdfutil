# pdfutil
This script was created in around two hours so expect ugly code, dumb design decisions and be aware of the Nose Demons (although I doubt anyone will ever use this but who knows)...
I had to merge PDFs and rotate them and somehow writing a python script was faster than finding an existing program doing that...

The way command line arguments are handled is inconsistent and janky but I can't be bothered.

## Dependencies
* Python3 obviously
	* the pip library pdfrw

## Usage
````bash
python3 pdfutil.py -h
```

If against all odds someone really uses this and finds a bug, feel free to report it.
In the even more rare case that you improved something, feel even more free to open a PR.
